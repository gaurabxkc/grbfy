// open.go implements the grbfy:// protocol handler.
//
// `grbfy open <uri>` is what a desktop environment runs when someone clicks
// a grbfy:// link. It is the only entry point that acts on a string chosen
// by a web page, so it does two things carefully:
//
//   - Every URI goes through deeplink.Parse first, which validates the whole
//     grammar and returns a closed struct. Nothing from the URI is ever used
//     as an IPC operation name.
//   - dispatch maps the parsed action onto a fixed set of operations written
//     out longhand below. Adding a reachable operation requires editing this
//     file, which is the point.
