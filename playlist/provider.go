// Section is optional: providers may set it to group their playlists in the UI.
// Adjacent rows that share a Section are rendered under one header; a change of
// Section emits a "── header ──" divider. The radio provider uses
// SectionedList.IDPrefix instead and leaves Section empty.

// DirSourceCount is optional: providers that back playlists with [[dir]]
// directory sources set it so the UI can flag them in the list. A zero value
// means "none/unknown" and the UI hides the indicator.
