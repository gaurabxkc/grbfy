// filterRemoteEntries drops tracks from a network-fetched playlist whose path

//
// The entry strings in a remote M3U or PLS are chosen by whoever serves it,
// not by the user, and they become track paths that playback dispatches on.
// An ssh:// entry reaches exec.Command("ssh", ...) against a server-named
// host; file:// and data: entries are not playable but are worth refusing on
// the same principle. Fetching a playlist should never let its author pick
// which program grbfy runs.
//
// Entries with no scheme are left exactly as they were. They are relative or
// local paths whose handling predates this check, they cannot name a
// transport, and quietly dropping them would change what users see in their
// playlists. A single-letter prefix is treated as a Windows drive rather than
// a scheme, so "C:\music\a.mp3" survives.
