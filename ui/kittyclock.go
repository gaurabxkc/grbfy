// Drawing the pomodoro clock as a real image rather than block characters.

// setup that is a rectangle of roughly 190 screen pixels. No arrangement of
// block characters escapes that: curves step in whole cells, and shading the
// edges only trades a staircase for visible grey blocks.
//
// The kitty graphics protocol draws at real screen resolution instead. Raw
// graphics escapes do not survive Bubbletea's cell renderer, but *Unicode
// placeholders* do: the image is transmitted out of band, and the view then
// prints ordinary characters that the terminal composites the image behind.
// Bubbletea only ever sees text.

// Each glyph is transmitted once, before the program starts, so nothing is
// ever written to the terminal while Bubbletea owns it. Changing the time
// afterwards only changes which placeholders are printed.
